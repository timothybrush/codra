## 📦 Repository Layout

Codra is migrating to an npm workspace monorepo. The repository is structured into `apps/` (deployable entrypoints) and `packages/` (reusable modules):

```text
packages/
├── schema/             # Shared types + zod contracts (zero dependencies)
├── core/               # Review engine (pure ports, depends on schema)
├── db/                 # Postgres interactions and migrations (depends on schema, core)
├── models/             # LLM provider integrations (depends on schema, core)
├── provider-github/    # GitHub API adapter (depends on schema, core)
├── api/                # Hono router and API routes (depends on schema, core, db, models, provider-github)
└── ui/                 # React design system and primitives (depends on schema)

apps/
├── worker/             # Cloudflare Worker entrypoint (wires bindings to api ports)
└── dashboard/          # React SPA frontend (depends on ui, schema)
```

**Note:** We are incrementally migrating code from the legacy `src/` directory into this workspace structure. New logic should be placed in the appropriate `packages/` or `apps/` directory when possible.

## 🛠️ Local Development Setup

Codra is a monorepo-style project built with **Hono** (Worker), **React** (Vite), and **Cloudflare Workers**.

### 1. Prerequisites
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (Latest LTS)
- [Wrangler CLI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/install-upgrading/) (`npm install -g wrangler`)
- A Postgres-compatible database and a Cloudflare Hyperdrive config.

### 2. Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/devarshishimpi/codra.git
cd codra
npm install
```

### 3. Environment Variables
Copy `.dev.vars.example` to `.dev.vars` and fill in your secrets:
```bash
cp .dev.vars.example .dev.vars
```
You will need to set up:
- A GitHub App (for webhooks/checks).
- A GitHub OAuth App (for dashboard authentication).
- `LLM_CONFIG_ENCRYPTION_KEY` for encrypting dashboard-managed provider API keys.
- LLM providers and model credentials from the Settings dashboard.
- A Hyperdrive local connection string for `wrangler dev`.
- A direct `DATABASE_URL` for migrations.

### 4. Running Locally
Codra uses `concurrently` to run the Vite frontend and the Wrangler worker simultaneously:
```bash
npm run dev
```
- Frontend: `http://localhost:5173` (proxied via Worker)
- Worker: `http://localhost:8787`

## 🧪 Testing

We use **Vitest** for unit and integration testing. `npm test` requires a disposable Postgres database, runs migrations against it, and then runs the full test suite.

The test runner loads `.env.test`, `.env.local`, `.env`, `.dev.vars`, and then `.env.test.example`. Override `TEST_DATABASE_URL` in one of the private env files when your local test database does not match the example URL.

```bash
# Run the full test suite
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run typecheck
npm run typecheck
```
