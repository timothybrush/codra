// Two production outages came out of `serveIndex`, each hidden behind the other, and both invisible to
// a suite that never requested an HTML page:
//
//   1. `fetch` pulled off the ASSETS binding into a local -- the runtime rejects a detached binding
//      method with "Illegal invocation", so every HTML route 500'd while the API kept answering.
//   2. Once that was fixed, the handler asked the binding for `/index.html`, which Workers assets
//      canonicalize into a 307 back to `/` (html_handling: auto-trailing-slash). With `/` in
//      run_worker_first the redirect re-enters the same handler: ERR_TOO_MANY_REDIRECTS for everyone.
//
// MockAssets now reproduces both runtime behaviours, so this file covers the least glamorous thing
// there is: that the app serves its own index, as content, in one round trip.
