 * Owns the whole loading state - the chart chunk *and* the data - so the skeleton is one element in
 * one tree position for the entire wait.
 *
 * This deliberately avoids `lazy` + `Suspense`: with a fallback, the skeleton renders from a second
 * position, so the handoff between "no data yet" and "chunk still downloading" unmounts one
 * skeleton and mounts another. Identical markup, but React sees a new element - restarting the
 * shimmer and replaying the parent's `page-enter` fade-up, which reads as the cards refreshing
 * twice before any content arrives.
